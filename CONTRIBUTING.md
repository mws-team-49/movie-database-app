Just a guidance in how we will be creating our branches.
1. We would have one main branch i.e master
2. For every feature that a team member is working on you create your branch from  master and use the following naming conversion
   feature/...... e.g feature/movies_list_component
3. Create a merge request for team members to review
4. Code is merged into the master branch
